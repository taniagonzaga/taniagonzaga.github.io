8:58 is a short music video and a collaboration with Arnold Fuad.
We decided upon shooting in an deserted old ice cream factory in Bremen. After a few visits to the factory, and seeing the wrecking stage of the building, we settled on exploring the topic of time anxiety and imminent decay by placing a well dressed performer running around the building with no clear purpose, juxtaposing with the destruction of the surroundings. We invited Cassia Vila to perform and asked Ismael for his music. The final video  was exhibited at the early university open house student exhibition called Hochschultage.
