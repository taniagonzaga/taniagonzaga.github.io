The wndr is an application that revolves in the idea of collecting and sharing moments in a more abstract manner. Users can set up a time frame for collecting media and during this period are occasionally reminded to take pictures or make videos of their surroundings. Those media are compiled into a short abstract video composition called journey. It uses a glitch algorithm to transform real images, therefore showing a little bit of the user’s routine during a selected period.
