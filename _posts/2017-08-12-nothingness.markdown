This sound performance is an algorithmic feedback loop that transforms the spoken words by recording and playing it back randomly 1 second at the time, slowly destroying and deconstructing the speech until the words are no longer recognisable. 

Created based on the text "Uncounted" by Emily Roysdon and inspired by the works of Alvin Lucier’s "I am sitting in a room" and Virginia Woolf’s “The Waves”.

The work addresses the relevance of speech by playing with repetition and the potential of making and breaking structures.

This sound piece is a studio recording of the performance made at Schwankhalle Bremen, 2017. The original recording was edited to fit this video's duration.

Sound: microphone, speaker, PD patch.

Video: Kinect+processing, after effects.
