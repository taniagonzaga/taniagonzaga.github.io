Hey, I am Tania :D <br> I am a media designer from São Paulo, currently based in Germany. I graduated in Bachelor of Visual Communication at University Center Senac São Paulo, and I recently finished a Master in Digital Media (MA) at Hochschule für Künste Bremen. I am genuinely interested and curious about new trends in the society as well as in technology, I like to bring interesting and simple solutions to complex problems. I am passionate about designing things from objects to experiences. I work with a variety of media including video, sound, installations, graphic design, VR/AR and interactive media. 
My artistic practice is grounded on exploring the invisible and playing with human perception by adding layers of meaning to existing things. I have exhibited in a few festivals such: Festival do Minuto (São Paulo), Kino Pod Baranami (Kraków), Hochschultage (HFK Bremen), Lab30 (Augsburg), and TADAEX (Tehran).
<br>
Oh, and I am also interested in commercial works :)
